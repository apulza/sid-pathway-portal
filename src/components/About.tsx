                I'm a Computer Science student at Northeastern University's Khoury College of Computer Sciences,
                with a concentration in Artificial Intelligence and a minor in Business Administration.
              </p>
              <p>
                My academic journey has provided me with strong foundations in various programming languages
                and technologies, from Java and Python to AI/ML concepts and web development.
              </p>
              <p>
                I'm passionate about applying AI to solve real-world problems, as demonstrated by my research
                experience at Northeastern's AI Perception Lab and through my various projects.
