      description: [
        "Analyzed cryptocurrency price volatility across 3,376 coins using market capitalization and trading volume data from the CoinMarketCap API.",
        "Built and evaluated regression-based ML models (linear, polynomial, interaction terms) using NumPy and scikit-learn to assess predictability of crypto volatility.",
        "Found that market fundamentals explain <2.4% of volatility, demonstrating that crypto price movement is largely driven by sentiment, news, and speculation rather than traditional metrics.",
        "Produced a full end-to-end data science pipeline including data collection, cleaning, visualization, modeling, and statistical evaluation."

        "Designed a scalable relational schema (players, teams, games, injuries) supporting mid-season trades and multi-season expansion, with strict foreign key constraints and composite keys.",
        "Developed automated data pipelines using Google Apps Script (web scraping) and Java for data cleaning, ID mapping, and SQL generation.",
        "Discovered key insights including a negative correlation between team injuries and wins, high injury rates among wide receivers and cornerbacks, and lower-body injuries accounting for ~30% of all cases."
